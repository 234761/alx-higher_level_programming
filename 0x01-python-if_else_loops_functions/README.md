# Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, I began utilizing conditionals and loops in Python by using `if`, `if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `range` statements with `while` and `for` loops. I practiced writing my own Python functions while learning about scope of variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.

## Tasks

* **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  * `0-positive_or_negative.py`: Python script that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints whether `number` is positive or negative.
  * Prints the number followed by:
    * If the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
    * If the number is 0: `is zero`
    * If the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    * Followed by a new line.
  * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py).

* **The last digit**
  * `1-last_digit.py`: Python script that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number.
  * Prints the string `Last digit of [number] is` followed by:
    * If the number is greater than 5: `and is greater than 5`
    * If the number is 0: `and is 0`
    * If the number is less than 6 and not 0: `and is less than 6 and not 0`
    * Followed by a new line.
  * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py).

* **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  * `2-print_alphabet.py`: Python script that prints the alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line using only one `print` and one loop without storing characters in variables or importing modules.

* **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  * `3-print_alphabt.py`: Python script that prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line using only one `print` and one loop without storing characters in variables or importing modules.
  * Prints every letter except for `q` and `e`.
