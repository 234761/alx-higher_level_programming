# SQL - Introduction

This was my first project in which I began to work with SQL and relational
databases. I began practicing introductory data definition and data
manipulation language, making subqueries, and using functions.

## Tasks

* **0. List databases**
  * `0-list_databases.sql`: MySQL script that lists all databases of your
MySQL server.
